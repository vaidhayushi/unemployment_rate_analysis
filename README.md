Unemployment Rate Analysis in India During COVID-19
Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and analysis for the "Unemployment Rate Analysis in India During COVID-19" project. The project focuses on exploring and understanding the trends in unemployment rates across different states in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning models to predict and understand unemployment patterns.

1. Libraries Used
Pandas: A fundamental data manipulation library for efficient handling and analysis of the unemployment dataset.

Matplotlib: Primary visualization library for creating informative charts, graphs, and plots.

Seaborn: Data visualization library built on Matplotlib for creating aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical graphics.

Scikit-Learn: Robust machine learning library used for implementing and evaluating predictive models for unemployment rate analysis.

NumPy: Fundamental library for numerical operations in Python, indispensable for efficient array and matrix computations.

2. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
2.1. Data Collection and Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, providing comprehensive information on the Unemployment rate in India. It consists of 267 rows and 8 columns, including attributes such as States, Date, Estimated Unemployment Rate, and Region.

2.2. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
Data cleaning techniques were applied to ensure dataset integrity, including identifying and handling missing values. Column names were also corrected for better understanding.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis involved various data visualization techniques to unravel patterns and relationships within the unemployment dataset. Visualizations include correlation plots, state-wise unemployment rates, employed count by region, and a dashboard for analyzing state-wise unemployment rates.

4. Machine Learning Models
4.1. Explanation of the Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Random Forest Classifier: Versatile ensemble learning algorithm for classification tasks, applied to categorize unemployment rates or predict other categorical outcomes.

Linear Regression: Widely used algorithm for regression tasks, employed to predict numerical values or explore linear relationships within the dataset.

4.2. Data Splitting (Train-Test Split)
Data was split into training and test sets, with independent and dependent variables defined. The split allowed for training machine learning models on one subset and evaluating their performance on another.

4.3. Model Training and Evaluation
Two regression models were implemented:

Linear Regression Model: Explained about 7.69% of the variance in the Estimated Unemployment Rate.

Random Forest Regression Model: Achieved an R2 score of approximately 28.4%, indicating higher accuracy in explaining the variance.

5. Conclusion
The analysis suggests that the Random Forest Regression model provides a more robust predictive framework for estimating unemployment rates based on selected features. However, the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy should be considered for policymaking.
